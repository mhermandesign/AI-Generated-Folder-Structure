# AI Generated Folder Structure
A simple, single-file Python CLI app that reaches out to a generative model, requests an outline for a project folder structure, and creates those folders in a local directory.

Configure the script by modifying the properties located at the top of 'main.py'.

Simply run main.py, enter a project type and topic, and let the script to the rest.

Ensure you have a .env file at the root of the project folder containing a key-pair for API_KEY:

`API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
